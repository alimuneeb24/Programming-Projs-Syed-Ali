**First Edition –™ unofficially (but seriously)**  
*Built to be educational. But it's still malware.*

## ⚖️ ETHICS FIRST

Let’s not play dumb.

**PWNDOWS** is malware — straight up. It encrypts your files, drops a ransom note, and erases itself without a trace. It’s fast, efficient, and leaves nothing behind. It’s the kind of tool threat actors *dream* of.

But that’s not what this is about.

This was built for:

- 🧠 **Educational** purposes  
- 🧑‍💻 **Security research**  
- 🔬 Understanding malware anatomy to build better defenses  
- 📚 An attack technique as part of a cybersecurity exercise I participated in my university. 

**I do not support or encourage** the use of this project outside of:

- Controlled lab environments  
- CTFs  
- Cybersecurity research  
- Classroom demos (with consent)
- Controlled CyberSecurity Exercises 

> **If you use this for harm — you're the problem.**  
> Don't be the problem. :)

## 👁 WHAT IS PWNDOWS?

**PWNDOWS** is the first iteration/ installment in a growing malware series.  
It’s a minimal ransomware clone designed to mimic real-world tactics while being lightweight, understandable, and fast.

It's written in C for Windows and performs:

- 🔐 XOR-based file encryption  
- 📄 Ransom note drop with ASCII meme  
- 🧹 Delayed self-deletion using Windows command line  
- 🚫 No recovery, no forgiveness  

AV or Defender can't detect it before or during execution, and it wipes itself off the disk.  

> **You run it — it’s gone.** But your files are broken.

**Name: PWNDOWS**  
*Unofficially trademarked by me. This is my creation. This is version one.*

---

## 🧠 HOW IT WORKS (Technically Speaking)

- Scans current directory  
- Encrypts every file (except `OPEN_ME.txt`) with an XOR Key  
- Drops a ransom note with taunting ASCII art  
- Triggers a delayed background `cmd` call that self-destructs the binary  
- No mercy :)

It’s fast, simple, and brutal — like the early ransomware strains that caught the world off guard.

## 🧪 ROADMAP: PWNDOWS v2+

PWNDOWS is just getting started. Upcoming enhancements include:

- 🔐 **AES-256 encryption**  
  For real cryptographic strength — not baby XOR stuff

- 🧬 **File header corruption**  
  Break previews, thumbnails, extensions — make file recovery harder

- 🧻 **Rickroll injection**  
  Because you might as well vibe while your stuff gets torched

- 🗝 **Key management system**  
  Dynamic key generation, optional payload persistence, and unlock protocol for demos

- 📦 **Packed & obfuscated builds**  
  For realistic red teaming and evasion testing (ethically, of course)

## 🚫 WHY FULL SOURCE WON’T BE PUBLIC

Because this is dangerous.

The logic, ideas, and execution strategies are shared to spark curiosity and discussion.  
But the full, raw code won’t be public because:

- It can be weaponized  
- People are reckless  
- Some just want to watch the world burn
- and also well its intellectual property

If you’re smart enough to use this responsibly, you’re smart enough to build it yourself. :)

## FINAL WORD

This is **PWNDOWS**.    
It’s code that breaks things — to understand how to fix them.

> Learn how to hack. So you can protect.  
> Learn what evil looks like. So you can stop it.  
> Learn malware. **Be anti-malware.**

Stay dangerous — but stay ethical.
