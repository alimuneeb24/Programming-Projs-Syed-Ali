## 📌 Featured Projects Showcase

### 🌐 [Multithreaded HTTP Server](https://github.com/alimuneeb24/Programming-Projs-Syed-Ali/tree/main/Java_Projects/Multithreaded_HTTP_server)
A foundational HTTP server built from scratch in pure Java to demonstrate core backend principles. This project showcases a multithreaded architecture where each incoming client connection is handled by a separate worker thread, allowing the server to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

**`Tech:`** `Java` `Socket Programming` `Multithreading` `HTTP/1.1`

### 🛡️ [Pwndows - A Ransomware Anatomy Study](https://github.com/alimuneeb24/Programming-Projs-Syed-Ali/tree/main/Malware/PWNDOWS)
An educational tool developed to deconstruct and understand the anatomy of modern ransomware. By mimicking basic malware tactics in a controlled environment, this project serves as a powerful resource for developing better defensive strategies and detection signatures. Created for a university cybersecurity exercise to better understand attack vectors.

**`Tech:`** `C` `Windows API` `Malware Analysis` `Defensive Research`
